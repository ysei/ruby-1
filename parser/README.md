# The thing

This yet another ruby parser consists of three parts:

    * Lexer
    * Parser
    * Builder

The original ruby lexer/parser/ast-generator from `parse.y` has all these three parts in one file, but, unfortunately, tangled tightly without any abstraction of namespace isolation. All the ruby parsers out there have introduced strong isolation of the parts. So did we.

# The main parts

**Lexer** here is a line to line, bit to bit (I hope so) port of original `parse.y` lexer from C to JavaScript. With all the `goto`s emulated somehow. There are only a few regexps introduced for trivial things like checking alphabetical chars with `/^[a-zA-Z]/`. It tries to mimic each and every warning and error it can reach.

**Parser** is a precise copy of the original bison rules from bison part of `parse.y`. At this phase the parser relies on a port of bison state machine to JavaScript. It's a separated project called [bison-lalr1.js](https://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/bison-lalr1.js); AFAIKT, the JS port does exactly the same state transitions and produce identical error messages as the original `yacc.c` bison skeleton does (compared with `ruby -yc`).

**Builder** is a simplified port of [the ruby parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) AST generation part. It has a brilliant API, so the JS port tries to copy it word to word. As a pleasant outcome the JS port got the [sexy sexp](http://whitequark.org/blog/2012/10/02/parsing-ruby/) AST format too.

# Progress so far

It can lex, parse and build an AST for `giant.rb` of ~49000 lines of ruby code copied from Opal project, ActiveRecord gem, and Realties gem. It takes the parser 1.3 sec to do all the job: 37ms for bootstrap, and 1249ms for parsing.

Further optimizations needed to reduce the garbage produced by the lexer and the builder phases.


# First run

Prerequisites:

    brew install v8
    brew install bison # 2.7.1 at the moment

Run:

    make test

lots of output with "states", "shifts" etc.


# Bison rules!

If you need to touch around bison rules, please, run `make diff` to see, what changed. There must be no diff to parse.js.output :)

Then check the lexer.

# Lexer

To briefly test the lexer+parser tandem, run `make compare`. It will compare the parsing log of the original ruby and this parser. To do so you need to compile ruby 2.0.0-p195 with Bison 2.7.

# Ruby

To update the parser of the original ruby from Bison 2.3 (2006) to bison 2.7 (2012) install the new version of bison and delete file `parse.c` from its sources to force make calling bison.

And one more thing. Make your very own ruby 2.0.0-p195 (patch level matters in corner cases) executable visible by `ruby20` name.
